# Geosimulation Modelling - Course Project

For this project, we are implementing the model described in the following paper:

Ferreri, L., & Venturino, E. (2013). Cellular automata for contact ecoepidemic processes in predatorâ€“prey systems. *Ecological complexity*, *13*, 8-20.



## Notes 

* All outputs of the model without a pathogen are saved into the `output` folder. The folder has to exist already, otherwise Python will throw an error. 
* Correspondingly, outputs of the model where predators can get infected are saved in `outputInfectedPred`.
